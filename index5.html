          <p>
            An eating disorder causes people to obsess about their weight and
            what they eat. Because of the physical nature of their defining
            symptoms, eating disorders can cause both emotional distress and
            significant medical complications.
            <h3 class="display-3 fw-bold">Anorexia</h3>
            People with anorexia avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very 
            small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, 
            even when they are dangerously underweight.
            <h3 class="display-3 fw-bold">Bulimia</h3>            People with bulimia have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, 
            by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise 
            or fast.
            <h3 class="display-3 fw-bold">Binge Eating</h3>            Binge Eating is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorders keep 
            eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. 
            Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress.
