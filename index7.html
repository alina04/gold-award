            <p>
                The reason I chose this specific topic and this project was because
                of my sister. I was 12 at the time when she left home and began
                college. Now, I am in her position. However, little did I know then,
                that she was battling depression and anxiety, but went through it
                alone. At 12 years old, I didn’t know why she was feeling the way
                she was or how to help her. I could only watch her suffer as I stood
                by. Since then, she has fallen but has always managed to pick
                herself up and put herself back together. Now, I’m 17 and I’ve
                learned about her hardships and how she battled it all herself. This
                is a feeling I’ll never understand but it was something that hurt me
                to watch as I grew up. I want to share with the world that mental
                health issues shouldn’t be ignored and no one should have to fight
                alone. My sister has always been my inspiration because of how she
                fought alone yet became the amazing person she is today. Today, she
                is the one person I can always turn to and the one person I can
                always ask for advice. Not only has she grown as a person but she
                opened my eyes to how terribly mental health issues can take a toll
                on your life.
